## Luminovo Full-Stack Challenge
Welcome to Luminovo's Full-Stack Challenge! It's a series of 3 exercises that will help you get a feeling for the kind of work we do at Luminovo, and what engineering tasks you would likely face day-to-day. The goal for us is to get a better picture of how experienced you are in building web apps with Rust and Typescript, how easy to understand (and easy to change) your code is.

At times you might find the description a little vague, and think that you need some additional assumptions or context. We are happy for you to make those assumptions as long as they you mention them somewhere in a comment. If you get stuck you can also skip a challenge and go to the next one.

Good luck and have fun! :)

## Challenge 1 - Rust
Go to [rust/src/search](rust/src/search).

## Challenge 2 - Rust
