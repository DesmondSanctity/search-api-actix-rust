# Challenge 3: Google MPNs

We've got an endpoint! Now we want a frontend with which we can actually submit MPN search queries to the backend and display the highlighted results. 
It's up to you to design the search bar and what the results look like. Does not need to be fancy, but should include highlighting of parts of the MPN.

Please use Typescript and React!

Good luck. :)
